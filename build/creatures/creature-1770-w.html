Because of his great size and strength, all other animals feared him, with the exception, perhaps, of the mammoths. His body was striped with mottled patches of dark fur that allowed him to blend easily into shadows. Most creatures were his prey, and he knew no equal.<br><br> This all changed when Syarstik met the Wise One— an old human who would have made little more than a mouthful for the great cat. The shriveled man didn't fear Syarstik, nor did he threaten him, but rather spoke to the cat as an equal. After some time traveling together, the Wise One took Syarstik to an important burrow in a remote part of the plains, a site of old, powerful magic. There, the Wise One whispered sacred words, and Syarstik felt the man's words wash over him like running water. At once, a haze the cat had never noticed was lifted from his eyes, and he knew his true name, Syarstik, which meant “now you speak.” He also knew that the Wise One was dying. The ritual had exhausted the venerable man, and he gave Syarstik a command with his dying breath: to protect this sacred place from any who would desecrate it.<br><br> Syarstik faithfully fulfilled his old friend's final wish, remaining within the cave for many years, and found the sacred, solitary duty quite to his liking. When he was hungry, he would snatch white fish from the dark cave pond. When he was bored, he would chase deer or rodents in the dusty scrubs just outside the cavern's mouth. When intruders approached, he would coat his fur in red dirt to hide from his prey and, afterward, take long swims in the cave pool to cleanse himself of their blood.<br><br> Human-folk calling themselves Mammoth Lords visited his “Red Cat Cave” to paint stories of their trials and consult the stars through tiny holes in the cavern's ceiling. Syarstik regarded these visitors cautiously, but when they prostrated themselves respectfully and laid down their weapons, he allowed them entry. He oversaw many generations of such pilgrims, watching them grow from cubs to adults to wise ones. Yet, Syarstik himself never aged.<br><br> Over a century ago, a few of these human-folk came to Syarstik bearing a shrouded torch that somehow remained lit and that, when unsheathed, cast a blazing light that cut through the cave's darkness. The humans were clearly scared, and Syarstik nobly agreed to guard their sacred torch in his cavern. They spoke of demons who might come to take the torch, but Syarstik knew nothing of demons, and he felt no more fear of these foes than he did for any other animal.<br><br> Syarstik was thus taken by surprise when a wild-eyed human entered the cave a few winters later, spear in hand, to claim the eternal torch. This human—if that's truly what he was—stunk of fire and death, but also of something far worse than any other human-folk Syarstik had met. When Syarstik refused to let him take the torch, the warrior's sudden attack surprised the cave's guardian. The human stuck fast a spear in Syarstik's flank, and he was dying. With his last breath, Syarstik covered the sacred torch with his body, hoping to extinguish its eternal flame, but the torch continued to burn, and the immortal cat howled as his body was set ablaze.<br><br> With this final desperate act, Syarstik cursed the wretched artifact that had spelled his doom, preventing the bearer of the torch from ever willingly relinquishing it to another. From then on, the torch's bearer would know no peace and be shunned by all. The shadows of the howling tiger permeated the cavern walls, imbuing them with Syarstik's angry magic.<br><br> Even after his mortal body turned to ashes, Syarstik's spirit lingered in the spot where he died. Haunted by his failure to protect the cave, the ghost of the great cat now rages against all intruders, human or otherwise. For more than a century, the people of the Gornok Plains have given Red Cat Cave a wide berth, telling tales of the ghostly predator that guards it and the ancestral cave paintings within that leap to life. <h2 class="title">Campaign Role</h2> When the characters first meet Syarstik in Chapter 2 of this adventure, he's still maddened with grief and rage owing to his failure to protect the <i>Primordial Flame</i>. He attacks with his full fury, trying to turn the cave itself against these new intruders by animating the cave paintings. Only once the characters have bested him in combat or broken his connection to the cave paintings does Syarstik realize that they're unaffiliated with the Kellid and the demon who took the artifact away.<br><br> Once he has been calmed, Syarstik gives the characters his full account of what happened in Red Cat Cave 120 years ago. He tells them about the Kellid warrior Metuak and the demon who possessed him as well as the curse Syarstik levied upon the <i>Primordial Flame</i> before his death. He doesn't know Metuak's final destination, but he knows that the warrior intended to travel through Lost Mammoth Valley to get there.<br><br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Recall Knowledge - Spirit</a></u> (<u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=11">Occultism</a></u>)</b>: DC 30<br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Recall Knowledge - Undead</a></u> (<u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=13">Religion</a></u>)</b>: DC 30<br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Unspecific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 28<br><b><u></u></b></a><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Specific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 25</a><h2><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563"></a><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1770&amp;Elite=true"><b>Elite</b></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1770"><b>Normal</b></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1770&amp;Weak=true"><u><b>Weak</b></u></a><br><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1770&amp;PWL=true"><b>Proficiency without Level</b></a></h2>Changes from being <u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791">Weak</a></u> are marked in <span class="EWChange"><b>red</b></span> below.<br><i><b>NOTE</b>: The -2 damage penalty to non-strike offensive abilities (-4 if the ability is limited, such as spells) is NOT factored in.</i><h1 class="title"><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1770">Weak Syarstik Painted-Tiger</a><span style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Creature 5</span></h1><a target="_blank" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images\Monsters\SyarstikPaintedTiger.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Images\Monsters\SyarstikPaintedTiger.png"></a><span alt="Unique Trait" class="traitunique" title="A rules element with this trait is one-of-a-kind.

 An incorporeal creature can’t attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects—only against incorporeal ones—unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can’t attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects.

 Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage.
