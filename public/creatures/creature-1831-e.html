<span id="ctl00_RadDrawer1_Content_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><h1 class="title">Hegremon, Human Hunter of the Tusk Mountains</h1>Leader of the Graylok clan of frost giants, Hegremon is a lonely and isolated creature feared by his own people.<br><br> Growing up, Hegremon was never among the largest or the strongest of his kind. In frost giant culture, this meant he was destined to be something of a failure. While his kin competed in feats of fantastic strength, Hegremon retreated to the wilderness to avoid embarrassment. Keen-sighted, patient, and clever, he lived alone and learned the ways of the wild beasts that dwelled in the Tusk Mountains, returning occasionally to the Graylok village before departing again. Few even noticed his absence.<br><br> From a remote mountaintop cabin, Hegremon tracked the migratory routes of mammoth herds, laid a trap, and slew a mighty bull. He fashioned his distinctive weapon, a bow of solid ivory, from the tusks of the mammoth. Hegremon crept to a safe position above the Graylok village and slew his clan leader with a single, well-placed arrow.<br><br> This forged Hegremon's legend in an instant. His clanmates revered him as a mythic figure who vanished into the snow and returned with death at his command. They came to idolize and obey him, but Hegremon had only contempt for his followers—after all, they had treated him with scorn for years before he revealed himself a capable killer. His loneliness and isolation intensified, even as fanatical followers surrounded him. In sullen frustration and rage, he set his sights higher.<br><br> Frost giants have many jarls, but the greatest among them is Jarl Gnargorak. When Hegremon became leader of the Grayloks, he led his people to Gnargorak's hall and paid homage to his king. But the mighty jarl dismissed the young hunter as weak, insignificant, and undeserving of his title. The humiliation wounded Hegremon deeply. He was—and always would be—a creature driven by a need for acceptance.<br><br> Withdrawing to the Tusk Mountains, Hegremon sought allies. In his years of isolation during his youth, Hegremon met many wanderers. Among them was a Kellid named Ivarsa, a warrior-witch who wielded the banner of the legendary Burning Mammoth. Defying his people's long-held traditions of distrust for all Kellids, Hegremon invited Ivarsa to his village to learn more about her quest for allies. He learned she sought the <i>Primordial Flame</i>, a terrible artifact of fire and light spoken of by frost giants much the way humans talk of bogeymen. Ivarsa wanted the artifact for the power it gave her, but Hegremon considered other uses for it: If he were to win the flame, could he gain Gnargorak's acceptance? Would this prove his worth at last? Hardly able to contain his anticipation, he sent a missive to Gnargorak promising to obtain the mythical lantern.<br><br> Hegremon and Ivarsa joined forces to search for the <i>Primordial Flame</i>, but their efforts were frustrated for years. Finally, in a raid on Hillcross, Hegremon captured Jesseri the Hailstorm, a historian who knew the tale of Metuak. From her, Hegremon and Ivarsa learned Metuak fled to the Tamarnian Tar Forest to rid himself of the flame's curse. Somewhere along the way, he lost the sacred lantern. Ivarsa rallied her following north and west to chase the Broken Tusk along the same route Metuak had taken. Hegremon mustered his Graylok kin to cut off fleeing Tusks. By the time the Broken Tusk took shelter in Hillcross, hundreds of frost giants were ready to assault the encampment in search of the Primordial Flame. <h2 class="title">Campaign Role</h2> Hegremon never intended to lead his fellows into battle against Hillcross. Rather, he correctly anticipates the siege will flush out Broken Tusk leaders and spur them to find a way to break the flame's curse in the Tamarnian Tar Forest, just as Metuak had. When the characters follow Metuak's path into the tar forest, Hegremon plans to follow and kill them one by one. He'll then take the <i>Primordial Flame</i> from their corpses and present it to Gnargorak.<br><br> If the jarl still doesn't accept Hegremon, even in the face of such obvious strength, what then?<br><br> He'll just have to kill Gnargorak, too.<br><br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Recall Knowledge - Humanoid</a></u> (<u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=14">Society</a></u>)</b>: DC 41<br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Unspecific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 39<br><b><u></u></b></a><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Specific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 36</a><h2><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563"></a><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1831&amp;Elite=true"><u><b>Elite</b></u></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1831"><b>Normal</b></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1831&amp;Weak=true"><b>Weak</b></a><br><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1831&amp;PWL=true"><b>Proficiency without Level</b></a></h2>Changes from being <u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790">Elite</a></u> are marked in <span class="EWChange"><b>red</b></span> below.<br><i><b>NOTE</b>: The +2 damage bonus to non-strike offensive abilities (+4 if the ability is limited, such as spells) is NOT factored in.</i><h1 class="title"><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1831">Elite Hegremon</a><span style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Creature 13</span></h1><a target="_blank" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images\Monsters\Hegremon.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Images\Monsters\Hegremon.png"></a><span alt="Unique Trait" class="traitunique" title="A rules element with this trait is one-of-a-kind.
