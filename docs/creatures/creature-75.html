In addition to being even larger than azure or purple worms, the crimson worm has a penchant for burrowing through volcanic regions that, over the generations, have infused it with a supernatural link to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The molten heart of an active volcano is an attractive lair for a crimson worm, as are the sprawling fields of bubbling magma found in the deepest reaches of the Darklands. Legends from ancient peoples, precursor dwarven societies, and colonists of the Elemental Planes populated moats of lava with crimson worms likely have some basis in truth, although the methods such ancients used to keep these “moat worms” contained and prevented them from chewing their way through fortress foundations must have been significant.<br><br> Crimson worms sometimes frequent areas on the surface where volcanism creates hot springs or other geothermal features, but even then they prefer to spend most of their time burrowing through the ground in their never-ending search for sustenance. Surface lands claimed by crimson worms are notable for the mound-shaped burrows these creatures leave behind as they dig.<br><br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Recall Knowledge - Beast</a></u> (<u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=2">Arcana</a></u>, <u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=10">Nature</a></u>)</b>: DC 43<br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Unspecific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 41<br><b><u></u></b></a><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Specific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 38</a><h2><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563"></a><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=75&amp;Elite=true"><b>Elite</b></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=75"><u><b>Normal</b></u></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=75&amp;Weak=true"><b>Weak</b></a><br><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=75&amp;PWL=true"><b>Proficiency without Level</b></a></h2><h1 class="title"><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=75">Crimson Worm</a><span style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Creature 18</span></h1><a target="_blank" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images\Monsters\CaveWorm_CrimsonWorm.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Images\Monsters\CaveWorm_CrimsonWorm.png"></a><span alt="Rare Trait" class="traitrare" title="This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world.

Named for their distinctive colorations, these worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms of different colors and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world—tales speak of white worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and gray worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few.<h3 class="title"><img alt="Sidebar - Additional Lore" title="Sidebar - Additional Lore" style="height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px" src="Images\Icons\Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png"> Belly of the Beast</h3>The adventure need not end simply because the party was ingloriously swallowed whole by a giant cave worm. Perhaps the PCs find an undigested item that helps them survive the inhospitable environ, or maybe the worm regurgitates them in a cavern far off from where they started. Whatever the specifics, you can easily draw from folklore and popular fiction to create your own "belly of the worm" adventure for heroes who wind up on the wrong side of the monster’s scales.<h3 class="title"><img alt="Sidebar - Related Creatures" title="Sidebar - Related Creatures" style="height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px" src="Images\Icons\Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png"> Cave Worm Guardians</h3>Cave worms are notoriously dim witted, driven primarily by purely animalistic needs to feed and reproduce. This hasn’t prevented attempts to use them as guardians for their lairs, if not to tame them. Magic can be used to maintain control over a worm, but gifted, patient, and brave animal trainers can condition cave worms to serve in all manner of roles, such as living siege engines, shocking methods of executing foes, or merely pets.<h3 class="title"><img alt="Sidebar - Additional Lore" title="Sidebar - Additional Lore" style="height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px" src="Images\Icons\Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png"> Notorious Worms</h3>Some societies view the immense cave worms as natural disasters or incarnations of wrathful gods. Cave worms that have been active in a region often become part of that area’s local lore. For example, in the notorious Cinderlands of eastern Varisia, Shoanti have long told tales of Cindermaw, an immense crimson worm viewed by some as worthy of worship, and by others as the ultimate test of bravery.<h3 class="title"><img alt="Sidebar - Additional Lore" title="Sidebar - Additional Lore" style="height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px" src="Images\Icons\Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png"> Ravenous Tunnelers</h3>Cave worms are infamous for being nearly unstoppable and for swallowing their prey whole. A cave worm also ingests earth and minerals as it tunnels. The worm processes some of these minerals, resulting in its armored hide and toxic sting, while it leaves others behind—often including treasure or other valuables that incidentally serve to lure explorers into the worm’s proximity and, more often than not, its gullet. While not completely mindless, cave worms are difficult to train, and most attempts to domesticate them (in theory, a cave worm would make an excellent mining resource) result in disaster.</span>
