Wizard sponge does just that, dutifully cleaning its vicinity by devouring dust, organic debris, and even the decaying bodies of fallen creatures. Its designer intentionally crafted the fungus to not merely resist but be healed by fire, intended as an additional safety feature, and most varieties have a convenient side effect of being edible once slain. Unfortunately, the fungus also developed an unexpected ability to magically mutate over time, which eventually led to its escape and independent propagation.<br><br> Wizard sponge colonies of various sizes and shapes now thrive in dungeons, caverns, sewers, abandoned castles, crypts, and even the basements of some occupied dwellings. They often carry along bits of partially consumed material with them, such as clothing, limbs, and adventuring gear—sometimes even valuable treasures! An individual colony typically takes on distinctive properties based on what it's consumed in its environment; a variety living in a necromancer's crypt might acquire the undead's affinity for negative energy, for example. <h2 class="title">Variant Sponges</h2> Many types of wizard sponge exist, as an individual colony takes on distinctive properties based on what they've consumed in their environment. <br><br><b>Crypt</b>: The wizard sponge gains <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42">negative healing</a>. <br><br><b>Fey Domain</b>: The wizard sponge gains weakness 5 to <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=375">cold iron</a>, increases its Speed and climb Speed to 30 feet, and develops a strangely capricious growth pattern despite being mindless, such as growing in the pockets of a creature's clothing before devouring it. <br><br><b>Fiendish Temple</b>: The sponge gains weakness 5 to good damage, and Swarming Slither deals an extra 1d6 evil damage. <br><br><b>Toxic Lair</b>: Swarming Slither deals 1d10 acid damage and 1d10 poison damage.

Some refer to them as “wizard's broom,” while others reference their origins with the name “sloth's folly.” Those found in crypts have come to be known ironically as “caretakers,” and underwater denizens refer to the aquatic variety as “surface sponge.”</span>
