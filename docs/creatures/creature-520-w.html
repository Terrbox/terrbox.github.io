<span id="ctl00_RadDrawer1_Content_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><h1 class="title">Herecite of Zevgavizeb</h1>Secreted away in the dark corners of unnamed libraries, necromancer’s dens, and heretical scriptoriums, obscure texts describe a horrifying ritual that combines sacrifice and suffering to create a powerful undead being known as a herecite. These monsters, stripped of personal will or desire, are born into the service of an evil god whom they worship unerringly and untiringly, often in spite of any opposing religious leanings they may have had in life. Every herecite harbors an unquenchable self-hatred because it was defiled by such a foul resurrection—a rage it turns outward in an attempt to rob others of their faith and lives.<br><br> Herecites often outlast the cults that create them. Stranded herecites are drawn to others of their kind, even if they are dedicated to different evil deities, and when brought together they perform rites to magically bind themselves in a group known as a cabal. While cabal members share enhanced magic and defenses, induction into a cabal appears to hold even deeper significance for herecites. The presence of others of their kind with whom they can pray—in verses warped to venerate wicked gods—seems the only solace these tormented beings can find in undeath. Such a fellowship of sorrow is nigh unbreakable, as many an overzealous crusader has discovered far too late.<br><br> Customarily found within heavily modified temples to the pantheon of gods they collectively worship, herecites act in service to their creators or as protectors of unholy ground. High priests of different evil gods may even trade herecites among themselves, allowing their minions to form cabals strengthened by their varied faiths. A lone herecite cut off from its creators—often because it is the sole remnant of a destroyed temple or its master has perished—may wander far and wide in search of a cabal to join. Other times, the herecite seeks out a place sacred to the deity it worshipped in life. Whether motivated by a desire for contrition or vengeance, the end result of this baleful pilgrimage is always the desecration of the holy site and the slaughter of its congregants, who may in turn rise as lesser forms of undead.<br><br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Recall Knowledge - Undead</a></u> (<u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=13">Religion</a></u>)</b>: DC 29<br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Unspecific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 27<br><b><u></u></b></a><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Specific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 24</a><h2><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563"></a><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=520&amp;Elite=true"><b>Elite</b></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=520"><b>Normal</b></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=520&amp;Weak=true"><u><b>Weak</b></u></a><br><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=520&amp;PWL=true"><b>Proficiency without Level</b></a></h2>Changes from being <u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=791">Weak</a></u> are marked in <span class="EWChange"><b>red</b></span> below.<br><i><b>NOTE</b>: The -2 damage penalty to non-strike offensive abilities (-4 if the ability is limited, such as spells) is NOT factored in.</i><h1 class="title"><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=520">Weak Herecite of Zevgavizeb</a><span style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Creature 10</span></h1><a target="_blank" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images\Monsters\Herecite.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Images\Monsters\Herecite.png"></a><span alt="Uncommon Trait" class="traituncommon" title="Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world.

A cabal consists of two to five herecites. The ritual to form a cabal (or to welcome new herecites into an existing cabal) requires 24 hours of worship, prayer, and vile sacrifice, after which point the herecites become magically bound to one another. All herecites in a cabal gain the cleric domain spells granted by each individual herecite’s deity, and each herecite’s focus pool increases to 3 Focus Points. As long as the cabal exists, herecites in the cabal gain a +2 status bonus to Perception checks and fast healing 10. These benefits persist as long as the cabal consists of two or more herecites that remain within 1 mile of one another.<br> <b>Herecite Deity</b> A herecite is associated with one evil god and is always of the same alignment as that god. Whenever it wields its deity’s favored weapon, that weapon gains the <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=307"><i>unholy</i></a> rune. The herecite’s creators select two domains from their deity; the herecite can cast the domain spells and the advanced domain spells from those domains as cleric focus spells. The herecite can cast the deity’s other granted cleric spells as divine innate spells. Most herecites have 2 Focus Points in their focus pool.

As long as the creature is cursed, any art object, symbol, or implement of religious significance in the creature’s possession—such as a divine spellcasting focus, holy text, fetish, or rendering of a deity—becomes physically corrupted in a way that debases the deity’s tenets (a depiction of <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=17">Shelyn’s</a> songbird, for example, might lose its beautiful plumage to reveal a hideous skeletal form beneath).

The creature can cast off its corrupted objects to remove the stupefied condition, but any new religious objects it takes into its possession become similarly corrupted. The curse can be lifted by a <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=250"><i>remove curse</i></a> spell or by an <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=2"><i>atone</i></a> ritual.
