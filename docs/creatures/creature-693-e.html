These frog-like humanoids are uniquely adapted to their environment, with oversized eyes that give them keen vision in both light and dark and large toes that allow them to easily scale trees. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, with their physiologies influenced by their surrounding environment. Those who live in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes. In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled-brown coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and orange stripes. Typical gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately 30 pounds.<br><br> Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don't maintain typical farms like other humanoids do. Rather, they cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. While most gripplis hunt insects, some societies also capture and breed them, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that they eventually slaughter for food. Particularly enterprising gripplis might even seek out and tame larger flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.<br><br> Gripplis usually construct their villages in particularly dense copses, stringing thin rope bridges between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk. They make use of broad leaves and thick branches to further obscure their villages, making them especially difficult to spot from the forest floor, and riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they can navigate.<br><br> Grippli scouts typically keep watch on the outskirts of grippli settlements. More potent gripplis inhabit the settlements, be they religious leaders, powerful druids, or agile warriors that, due to their small size, focus more on finesse weapons and ranged attacks than on melee tactics.<br><br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Recall Knowledge - Humanoid</a></u> (<u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=14">Society</a></u>)</b>: DC 15<br><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Unspecific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 13<br><b><u></u></b></a><b><u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">Specific Lore</a></u></b><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563">: DC 10</a><h2><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=563"></a><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=693&amp;Elite=true"><u><b>Elite</b></u></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=693"><b>Normal</b></a> | <a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=693&amp;Weak=true"><b>Weak</b></a><br><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=693&amp;PWL=true"><b>Proficiency without Level</b></a></h2>Changes from being <u><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=790">Elite</a></u> are marked in <span class="EWChange"><b>red</b></span> below.<br><i><b>NOTE</b>: The +2 damage bonus to non-strike offensive abilities (+4 if the ability is limited, such as spells) is NOT factored in.</i><h1 class="title"><a target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=693">Elite Grippli Scout</a><span style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Creature 1</span></h1><a target="_blank" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Images\Monsters\Grippli_GrippliScout.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Images\Monsters\Grippli_GrippliScout.png"></a><span alt="Neutral" class="traitalignment" title="Neutral">N</span><span alt="Small" class="traitsize" title="Small">Small</span><span alt="Grippli Trait" class="trait" title="Gripplis are a family of frog-like humanoids.

The jungle also contains rivers and lakes filled with silver-scaled fish, which gripplis harvest in a sustainable manner to ensure their future supply, as well as fatty insects that grow much larger than in other parts of the world. Some of the most advanced grippli societies capture and breed these insects, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that are eventually slaughtered for food for the rest of the village. Particularly enterprising gripplis even seek out and tame huge flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts.

Gripplis obscure their holdings with broad leaves and thick branches, and they riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they know how to navigate. Their villages are usually constructed among the densest populations of trees, with thin rope bridges strung between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk.<h3 class="title"><img alt="Sidebar - Additional Lore" title="Sidebar - Additional Lore" style="height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px" src="Images\Icons\Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png"> A History of Neutrality</h3>Grippli villages rarely get involved in the concerns of other communities, preferring to focus on maintaining relative peace within their own small societies. Legends explain this attitude with a tale of a grippli champion who dragged his people into a war between humans and <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=109">charau-kas</a>. The stories differ as to which side the gripplis took, but every version ends with the bloody deaths of the hero and his family. Since that time, village elders claim, gripplis have done their best to remain far from the conflicts of others.<h3 class="title"><img alt="Sidebar - Additional Lore" title="Sidebar - Additional Lore" style="height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px" src="Images\Icons\Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png"> Baneback Origins</h3>Legends tell of a grippli warlord who bargained with the demon lord Jubilex to gain a foul power over poison and become the first baneback. He and his childrenâ€”all of whom bore a malignant toxinâ€” terrorized surrounding communities before being defeated and drawn into the <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Planes.aspx?ID=13">Abyss</a>. This legend explains gripplis' disdain for banebacks, though it's unclear if the trait is the lingering effect of a demonic bargain or simply a rare mutation.<h3 class="title"><img alt="Sidebar - Related Creatures" title="Sidebar - Related Creatures" style="height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px" src="Images\Icons\Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png"> Grippli Minions</h3>Gripplis keep company with few other intelligent species, but their close bond with nature means they may be found alongside giant insects, plant creatures, and other beasts of the jungle.<h3 class="title"><img alt="Sidebar - Related Creatures" title="Sidebar - Related Creatures" style="height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px" src="Images\Icons\Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png"> Rancorous Enclaves</h3>Exiled baneback sometimes band together to form their own villages, usually under the leadership of a jinxer. Given that some banebacks are violent malcontents, these villages don't last long unless the leader keeps order, usually by violence or fear. These villages often keep monstrous vermin, such as <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=585">giant cockroaches</a>, <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1611">giant tsetse flies</a>, or <a style="text-decoration:underline" target='blank' href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=826">giant ticks</a> as guards or mascots.<h3 class="title"><img alt="Sidebar - Treasure and Rewards" title="Sidebar - Treasure and Rewards" style="height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px" src="Images\Icons\Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png"> Treasure for Trade</h3>A grippliâ€™s knowledge is often more valuable than any of the handcrafted weapons or goods it carries. However, the most esteemed members of grippli communitiesâ€” alchemists, greenspeakers, and scoutsâ€”often carry alchemical creations, magic items, or valuables meant for trading with members of other jungle civilizations.</span>
